# Motion controlled lights
This automation aims at turning on the lights if the light target is below the set level by the `input number` and our `input_boolean` is not off. It then turns off when motion is cleared and after our delay caused by a `input number`.

### Requirements 
- Smart light bulbs 
- Motion sensor (with motion & lux sensor)
- Input number to control brightness target
- input number to control delay after motion is off
- Input boolean for manual control
